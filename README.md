# Frustrating Login Page

This project is an intentionally **frustrating** yet technically **functional** login page, created for a competition that challenges participants to **break all UI/UX rules** while maintaining usability.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Features That Will Annoy Users**
- **Too Many Required Fields** â€“ Users must fill out unnecessary details like their **least favorite date of the month** and **underwear color** before submitting.
- **Backspace Key is Disabled** â€“ Users **cannot erase** typos manually. The only way to fix mistakes is to click the **reset button**.
- **Reset Button Moves Randomly** â€“ Every **3 seconds**, the reset button jumps to a new position.
- **Strict & Nonsensical Validation Rules** â€“  
  - **Username must include an emoji, an animal name, a number, and start with a capital letter.**  
  - **Passwords must contain a Greek letter, punctuation, an 8-character palindrome, and no numbers.**  
  - **Age must be in Roman numerals.**  
  - **Email must be written in "nameatemaildotcom" format.**  
- **Random Error Messages** â€“ Users receive only **one error at a time**, making debugging impossible.
- **Even if Correct, Submission Fails** â€“ After completing all weird restrictions, users are greeted with:  
  > **"Congrats, you successfully wasted a lot of time!"**

## ðŸ›  **Tech Stack**
- **HTML** â€“ Structure of the page.  
- **CSS** â€“ Annoying animations and poor design choices.  
- **JavaScript** â€“ Implements validation rules, disables backspace, and moves the reset button.

## ðŸš€ **Live Demo**

## ðŸ“œ **How to Use**
1. Try to fill out the form.  
2. Realize how annoying it is.  
3. Try to correct mistakes but fail because **backspace is blocked**.  
4. Chase the moving reset button.  
5. Get confused by the ridiculous validation rules.  
6. Finally, after **minutes of struggle**, see the **infuriating success message**.

## ðŸ¤¦ **Why This Exists**
This project is a **humorous exploration** of how bad UX/UI can make simple tasks frustrating. It showcases **anti-patterns** in web design by violating best practices in a controlled, intentional way.
